Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website Deployment on AWS
Description:
The Personal Portfolio Website Deployment project involves creating a professional website to showcase your resume, portfolio,
and any other relevant information about yourself. You will design the website and deploy it on AWS, leveraging various AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and security.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: Create a modern and responsive design that looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

Portfolio Showcase: Include sections to showcase your projects, work experience, skills, and educational background.

Contact Form: Implement a contact form to allow visitors to reach out to you directly from the website. Utilize AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to send email notifications when someone submits the form.

Blog (Optional): If you're interested in blogging, integrate a blog section where you can share your thoughts, experiences, and insights. You can use a CMS like WordPress or a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby, and deploy it on AWS using services like Amazon Lightsail or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Domain Name: Register a domain name for your website and configure it to point to your AWS resources using Amazon Route 53.

SSL/TLS Certificate: Secure your website with an SSL/TLS certificate to enable HTTPS. You can obtain a certificate through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and associate it with your website.

Scalability and High Availability: Design your website architecture to be scalable and highly available. Utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling to distribute incoming traffic and automatically adjust capacity based on demand.
