Deploying a Personal Portfolio Website on AWS
Description:
The "Deploying a Personal Portfolio Website on AWS" project is aimed at creating and hosting a professional portfolio website using AWS cloud services. The website will showcase your skills, projects, resume, and contact information.

Key Features:
Frontend Development: Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop the frontend of the portfolio website. This includes creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces for different sections such as Home, About Me, Portfolio, Resume/CV, and Contact.

Backend Infrastructure with Django: Implement the backend of the website using the Django framework. Django will handle routing, data management, and server-side logic for the portfolio website. This includes integrating with AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) to store and manage dynamic content such as project details and contact form submissions.

AWS RDS Integration: Utilize AWS RDS to provision and manage a relational database for storing dynamic data associated with the portfolio website. This includes setting up database tables to store information such as project details, user data, and contact form submissions.

Deployment on AWS: Deploy the portfolio website on AWS infrastructure using services like Amazon EC2 for hosting the Django application and Amazon RDS for the backend database. Configure security groups and access control to ensure secure access to the deployed resources.

Scalability and Performance: Design the deployment architecture to be scalable and performant, allowing the website to handle varying levels of traffic efficiently. Utilize AWS Auto Scaling and load balancing services to ensure high availability and responsiveness.

Security and Compliance: Implement security best practices to protect the portfolio website and its data from potential threats. This includes configuring network security settings, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and adhering to AWS security guidelines and compliance standards.

Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging solutions using AWS CloudWatch to track the performance, availability, and health of the deployed infrastructure and applications. Configure alerts and notifications to proactively address any issues that may arise.

By completing the "Deploying a Personal Portfolio Website on AWS" project, gain practical experience in developing, deploying, and managing web applications on AWS cloud infrastructure. This project will not only showcase your frontend development skills but also demonstrate ability to integrate backend services like Django and AWS RDS for creating robust and scalable web solutions. Additionally, you will learn valuable concepts related to cloud deployment, security, scalability, and monitoring, which are essential for building modern web applications in real-world scenarios.
